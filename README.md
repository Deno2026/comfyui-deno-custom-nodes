Main features:

- works with the batch output from `(Deno) Multi Image Loader`
- auto-fills `num_images` from the connected loader when possible

## Why This Exists

These nodes are built to reduce repeated setup friction in actual ComfyUI production work.
The goal is not to chase huge feature lists. The goal is to make the workflows people repeat every day feel faster, cleaner, and easier to teach.
